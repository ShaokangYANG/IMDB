Project 2: Market-basket analysis
The task is to implement a system finding frequent itemsets (aka market-basket analysis), analyzing its datasets.

The «IMDB» dataset is published on Kaggle, under IMDb non-commercial licensing. The analysis is done considering movies as baskets and actors as items.
